# Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2023

I'm starting my year 2023 with [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp)
by [DataTalksClub](https://datatalks.club/).

I have always been captivated by computing, programming and data.
Even though I am no longer young (57 years old), I would like to pursue a job for a few
more years in DS or DE, after a busy career as a manager
in a large government organization.

This 9-week course focuses on data engineering and covers the following topics:

* [Week 1](week1.md): Introduction & Prerequisites (Docker, Terraform, GCP)
* Week 2: Workflow Orchestration (Prefect)
* Week 3: Data Warehouse (BigQuery)
* Week 4: Analytics engineering with dbt
* Week 5: Batch processing with Spark (Spark Dataframes & SQL)
* Week 6: Streaming with Kafka (Kafka Connect and KSQL, Avro schemas)
* Week 7, 8 & 9: Putting everything we learned to practice into a project
* Week 7 and 8: working on our project
* Week 9: reviewing your peers

Below, the project architecture:
